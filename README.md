# EyeOnPi: A Raspberry Pi-Based Surveillance System

## Project Overview
EyeOnPi is a surveillance camera system built using a Raspberry Pi. This project is the final assignment for a **Unix course** and demonstrates hardware and software integration to achieve real-time monitoring.

---

## Features
- Real-time video capture and streaming.
- Motion detection functionality.
- Remote access via a user-friendly interface.

---

## Objectives
- Apply Unix skills to configure and deploy a surveillance system.
- Leverage Raspberry Pi as an affordable and flexible hardware solution.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Raspberry Pi** - Core hardware platform
- **Camera Module** - For video capture

---

## Teamwork
This project was developed by **two team members**, ensuring an equal division of tasks.
Both members contributed to testing, troubleshooting, and documenting the final solution.

---

## Usage
1. Set up the Raspberry Pi hardware.
2. Install the required software tools.
3. Access the surveillance system through the provided interface.

---

## Solutions

### **Solution #1 - MotionEye**
For MotionEye, a camera-focused open-source software, very easy to set up with a user-friendly interface, using commands. This has all settings and configuration on web interface.

### **Solution #2 - Motion**
For Motion, another camera-focused software, set up with commands. This has all settings and configuration in a motion.conf file that would be edited with bash script language.
