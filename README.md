# EyeOnPi: A Raspberry Pi-Based Surveillance System

**Project Overview**
EyeOnPi is a surveillance camera system built using a Raspberry Pi. This project is the final assignment for a Unix course and demonstrates hardware and software integration to achieve real-time monitoring.

**Features**
Real-time video capture and streaming.
Motion detection functionality.
Remote access via a user-friendly interface.

**Objectives**
Apply Unix skills to configure and deploy a surveillance system.
Leverage Raspberry Pi as an affordable and flexible hardware solution.

**Technologies Used**
Raspberry Pi: Core hardware platform.
Camera.

**Usage**
Set up the Raspberry Pi hardware.
Install the required software tools.
Access the surveillance system through the provided interface.

**Solution #1**
For MotionEye, a camera-focused open-source software, very easy to set up with a user-friendly interface, using commands. This has all settings and configuration on web interface.

**Solution #2**
For Motion, another camera-focused software, set up with commands. This has all settings and configuration in a motion.conf file that would be edited with bash script language.
